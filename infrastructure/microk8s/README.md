# Microk8s

[Microk8s](https://microk8s.io/) is a tool that can be used to create a Kubernetes environment without having to have multiple physical nodes.

The Site Reliability GPT (SRGPT) Project uses Microk8s for local development while offering a pathway toward production level deployment scalability.

This should help minimize the distance from development to production for developers and operators interested in using the SRGPT tool.
